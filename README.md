# Team Profile Generator
  

  ## Description

  This application creates a HTML page for a team consisting of a manager, engineers, and interns, containing relevent information for each. It allows managers and other team leaders to quickly track and contact their teams. During the creation of this application, I gained a greater understanding of the use and application of JavaScript classes, asynchronous functions, and promises.
